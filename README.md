# OrderLunchWrap
Basic iOS app for my family to order a lunch wrap made by me

While working from home, I would make a delicious lunch wrap for myself every day.
My family also wanted them but would always ask for it after I was already done making mine.
My solution to this problem was to build them an app to place a mobile order so that they could order from thier respective offices without having to come find me.

This is a simple iOS app where you can place an order for a lunch wrap and it sends that order to me by text.
